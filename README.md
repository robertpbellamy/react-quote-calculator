This is a sample quote calculator inspired by the home removal quote calculator https://www.anyvan.com/.

React, React Redux and Redux Toolkit have been used to make the calculator interactive, making it quick and simple for users to obtain a quote.

The frontend communicates with microservices written in Go for each step of the quote process.
