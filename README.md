# React Quote Calculator
Sample portfolio project.

## Description
A common request I receive from clients is the development of a quote calculator for the products or services they sell on their website.

This is a sample quote calculator inspired by the home removal quote calculator on https://www.anyvan.com/.

React, React Redux and Redux Toolkit have been used to make the calculator more interactive and more enjoyable for users to use.

The frontend communicates with microservices written in Go for each step of the quote process.
