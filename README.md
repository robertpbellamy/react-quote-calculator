# React Quote Calculator
Sample portfolio project.

## Description
A common request I receive from clients is the development of a quote calculator for the products or services they sell on their website.

This is a sample quote calculator inspired by the home removal quote calculator on https://www.anyvan.com/.

React, React Redux and Redux Toolkit have been to make the calculator more interactive, making it quick & fun for users to obtain a quote.

The frontend communicates with microservices written in Go for each step of the quote process.
